# digit_recognizer
Handwritten digit recognizer using Keras,Tensorflow,Matplotlib,Numpy,OpenCV.

* Implemented and explored various Neural Network architecture to classify handwritten digits ranging from 0-9
using Tensorflow, Keras and other frameworks.
* Trained and improved the overall accuracy of the model using ”categorical crossentropy” as loss function,”relu”
as activation function of hidden layer and ”softmax” as activation function of output layer,and ”adam” as
optimizer.
* The final model had an accuracy of 0.97.
