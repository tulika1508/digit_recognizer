# digit_recognizer
Handwritten digit recognizer using Keras,Tensorflow,Matplotlib,Numpy,OpenCV.

* Implemented and explored various Neural Network architecture to classify handwritten digits ranging from 1-9
using Tensorflow, Keras and other frameworks.
* Trained and improved the overall accuracy of the model using ”categorical crossentropy” as loss function,”relu”
as activation function of hidden layer and ”softmax” as activation function of output layer,and ”adam” as
optimizer.
* The final model had an accuracy of 0.97.

Dataset used-MNIST(contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images).

Image of digits ranging from 1-9 has a size of 28X28 pixel.

Use of resnet architectures increase the accuracy of the model further.Resnet-18,34 or 50 can be used to further enhance the model.
Here I have used Resnet-18 to increase the accuracy to 0.99.
